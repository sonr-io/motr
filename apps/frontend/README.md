Welcome to your new TanStack app! 

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
bun install
bun --bun run start
```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
bun --bun run build
```

## SPA Mode

This application is configured to run in SPA (Single Page Application) mode, which provides several benefits:

- **Faster deployment**: No server-side rendering required
- **Cheaper hosting**: Can be served from any static file host (CDN, etc.)
- **Simpler infrastructure**: No need for server-side processing

### SPA Build Process

When you run `bun run build`, TanStack Start will:

1. **Prerender the shell**: Generate a static `/_shell.html` file containing the basic HTML structure
2. **Build client assets**: Create optimized JavaScript and CSS bundles
3. **Configure routing**: Set up client-side routing for all routes

### Authentication

The application includes WebAuthn passkey-based authentication using the Sonr SDK with client-side fetch functions:

- **Login** (`/login`): Authenticate with existing passkey
- **Register** (`/register`): Create new account with passkey
- **Session Management**: Uses localStorage for client-side session state

#### Authentication Flow

1. **Registration**: User creates account with passkey authentication
2. **Login**: User authenticates using their passkey
3. **Session**: Authentication state is stored in localStorage
4. **Logout**: Clears authentication state and redirects to home

#### Components Used

- **LoginFlow**: Handles passkey authentication for existing users
- **RegisterFlow**: Handles new user registration with passkey
- **Header**: Shows login/logout buttons based on authentication state

#### Client-Side Architecture

This application minimizes server function usage in favor of client-side fetch functions:

- **No server functions**: All data fetching and authentication is handled client-side
- **SPA mode**: Optimized for static hosting with prerendered shell
- **WebAuthn integration**: Uses Sonr SDK for passkey authentication
- **Local state management**: Authentication state managed via localStorage

### Deployment

For SPA mode deployment, ensure your hosting provider:

1. **Serves static assets** directly when they exist (e.g., `/assets/main.js`)
2. **Routes all 404s to the shell** - redirect `/*` to `/_shell.html` with a 200 status

#### Netlify Example

Create a `_redirects` file in your `public/` directory:

```
/* /_shell.html 200
```

#### Cloudflare Workers Example

If deploying to Cloudflare Workers, you would need to re-enable the Cloudflare plugin in `vite.config.ts` and configure for Workers deployment instead of SPA mode.

#### Static Deployment

For static hosting, upload the contents of the `dist/client/` directory to your hosting provider. The `bun run deploy` script builds the application for static deployment.

### Shell-Aware Components

The application uses `router.isShell()` to conditionally render components:

- **During prerendering**: Only shows the header logo and loading states
- **After hydration**: Shows interactive elements like navigation menus

This prevents hydration mismatches and ensures the shell loads quickly.

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
bun --bun run test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.




## Routing
This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from '@tanstack/react-router-devtools'

import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
})
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).


## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
bun install @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["people"],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).

## State Management

Another common requirement for React applications is state management. There are many options for state management in React. TanStack Store provides a great starting point for your project.

First you need to add TanStack Store as a dependency:

```bash
bun install @tanstack/store
```

Now let's create a simple counter in the `src/App.tsx` file as a demonstration.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

One of the many nice features of TanStack Store is the ability to derive state from other state. That derived state will update when the base state updates.

Let's check this out by doubling the count using derived state.

```tsx
import { useStore } from "@tanstack/react-store";
import { Store, Derived } from "@tanstack/store";
import "./App.css";

const countStore = new Store(0);

const doubledStore = new Derived({
  fn: () => countStore.state * 2,
  deps: [countStore],
});
doubledStore.mount();

function App() {
  const count = useStore(countStore);
  const doubledCount = useStore(doubledStore);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => countStore.setState((n) => n + 1)}>
        Increment - {count}
      </button>
      <div>Doubled - {doubledCount}</div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

We use the `Derived` class to create a new store that is derived from another store. The `Derived` class has a `mount` method that will start the derived store updating.

Once we've created the derived store we can use it in the `App` component just like we would any other store using the `useStore` hook.

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use TanStack Store in the [TanStack Store documentation](https://tanstack.com/store/latest).
